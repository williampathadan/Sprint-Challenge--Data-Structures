3. What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?

   Hash Tables store data at the index that match the hash value of the key that is associated with the data. Therefore, it is easy to retrieve value from the hash table since we know where the value is stored.

   Whereas in arrays, an iteration may be required to find the value.

   Speed and performance are the advantages of Hash Tables over Arrays.
